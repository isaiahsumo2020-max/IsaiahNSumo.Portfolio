                    <p>I was born on <strong>July 5, 1999</strong>, at CB Dumba Hospital, located in the Civil Compound
                        Community, Gbarnga City, Bong County, Republic of Liberia. I was born into the relationship of
                        <strong>George Sumo</strong> and <strong>Hellena N. Sengbeh</strong>, both from the Kpelleh
                        ethnic group, though their relationship did not last. The letter "<strong>N</strong>" in my name
                        stands for "<strong>Nyenian</strong>," a Kpelleh name meaning "<em>The World</em>." This name
                        was given to me by my aunt, <strong>Annie T. Sumo</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>I grew up in the Civil Compound Community under very challenging circumstances. After my parents
                        separated, my mother relocated to the village, leaving me behind in the city. I remained with my
                        grandparents, my aunts, and my father in Gbarnga. As a young child who had just begun walking, I
                        became seriously ill. My family did everything they could, chartering me and exhausting all
                        available options, to help me recover. This was during a time when Liberia was still emerging
                        from 14 years of civil crisis, and life was extremely difficult. By God's mercy and my family's
                        dedication, I survived.</p>

                    <p>I was raised mainly by my aunt (<strong>Esther N. Sumo</strong>) and grandparents, who played a
                        vital role in my early upbringing. My grandparents depended on a sugarcane farm, located about
                        one hour and ten minutes' walk from Civil Compound, as their main source of income. In
                        <strong>2007</strong>, my grandfather, <strong>Mr. Sumo B. Dolo</strong>, promised to enroll me
                        in school the following year (<strong>2008</strong>). Unfortunately, that promise could not be
                        fulfilled, as he fell ill and passed away on <strong>June 8, 2008</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>After his death, I was left in the care of my grandmother, aunts, and father. In <strong>October
                            2008</strong>, my uncle, <strong>Mr. Moses Mulbah Sumo</strong>, took me to stay with him
                        closer to the family farm. He also owned a sugarcane and vegetable garden in the same area. I
                        lived with him until mid-2010 (July), when he decided to migrate to Montserrado County with the
                        intention of settling down and later sending for me.</p>

                    <p>I then returned to Civil Compound to live with my grandmother and other family members. I was
                        finally sent to school for the first time at the age of <strong>11</strong>, during the
                        <strong>2010–2011 academic year</strong>. I started at <strong>Kingdom Garden (ABC) at
                            Jorphenmue Public School (JPS)</strong> in the Jorphenmue Community, Gbarnga City. After a
                        few months in school, I fell seriously ill again, so critically that my family nearly lost me.
                        By God's grace and through their care, I fully recovered. That same academic year, I was
                        promoted to the next class during the first semester, and by the end of the year, I advanced to
                        <strong>K-2</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>During the <strong>2011–2012 academic year</strong>, I enrolled at <strong>Dolo Community School
                            (DCS)</strong> in the Rubber Factory Community, Gbarnga City, where I completed the Kingdom
                        Garden division. I later returned to Jorphenmue Public School, where I completed my entire
                        elementary education. During this period, I received several double promotions due to my
                        academic performance.</p>

                    <p>From kindergarten through the end of elementary school (6th grade), <strong>2010–2016</strong>,
                        my education was sustained through the support of my grandmother, father and aunts, and other
                        kind individuals within the community, with occasional visit from my mother and started paying
                        visits to her. These were people who helped me because of my good behavior, respect, and
                        discipline, at a time when financial stability was never guaranteed.</p>

                    <p>Sadly, many of my major support systems collapsed around the same period. My grandmother was
                        diagnosed with breast cancer, and my aunt <strong>Esther N. Sumo</strong>, who had taken care of
                        me from the age of 2 to 7, suffered a brief illness in <strong>2013</strong> that resulted in
                        her losing sight within the same week. Not long after, my grandmother, <strong>Ma. Gbarngo G.
                            Sumo</strong> passed away on <strong>November 14, 2014</strong>, shortly after the Ebola
                        epidemic. She loved me deeply, just as my grandfather did; I was truly one of her heartbeats.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the <strong>2016–2017 academic year</strong>, I enrolled at <strong>Dorothy Cooper Elementary
                            & Junior High School</strong> located Brooklyn Community, Lofa Road, where I completed 7th
                        grade and was promoted to 8th grade.</p>

                    <p>At the age of <strong>18</strong>, on <strong>Wednesday, July 21, 2017</strong>, I traveled to
                        Montserrado County to spend vacation with my uncle in Parker Paint, Wood Camp Community,
                        Paynesville. One early morning, my uncle surprised me by telling me I would not be returning to
                        Bong County but would instead stay with him to further my education in Montserrado. This was an
                        emotional and exciting moment for me. I hugged my uncle and said, "<strong>Thank you so much,
                            Uncle. I am grateful.</strong>"</p>

                    <p>A few weeks later, my cousin recommended me to a friend who was looking for a child to stay with
                        her family and assist them in the Baptist Seminary Community, along the Rubber Field Highway.
                        While staying there, I attended <strong>Brian John Knightley Academy</strong>. Unfortunately,
                        due to family issues in that household, I was unable to complete the academic year. I was sent
                        back to my uncle's place just as I was preparing to write my third marking period and exams,
                        despite having a strong chance of being promoted to 9th grade after the first semester.</p>

                    <p>At that moment, I spoke to myself and said: "<em>I know my background and the kind of family I
                            come from. There is no guaranteed support. I must stand firmly to achieve what I want in
                            life, and God will surely fulfill His purpose for me. I will reach my destination one
                            day.</em>" I also learned that in life, people often take your kindness for weakness.</p>

                    <p>My uncle immediately ensured that I would not sit at home. He enrolled me at <strong>Jawalah
                            Community School (JCS)</strong> in the Wood Camp Community. He also contacted my father and
                        explained the seriousness of my situation, emphasizing that my future depended on collective
                        support. At the time, my father was engaged in construction contract work, and despite the
                        instability of the job, he was able to extend meaningful support toward my education.</p>

                    <p>During this period, I began actively contributing to my education by engaging in small-scale
                        trading. I sold cheese, biscuits, and other small items I could carry by hand in markets and
                        public areas, to add to what my uncle had. I also received occasional help from my father. I was
                        loved by many people I encountered because of the way I carried myself as a <strong>disciplined,
                            dedicated, and determined young man.</strong></p>
                    <p>By <strong>2019–2020</strong>, I enrolled at <strong>Pipeline Junior & Senior High School
                            (PJSHS)</strong>, where I completed 10th through 12th grades. At this stage, I largely
                        sponsored myself by selling cold juice for a lady in the community. For selling cold juice, I
                        earned 20 LD for every 100 LD I made, which meant I was paid only 20 percent of my total sales.
                        The highest amount I could make in total sales on a good day was usually not more than 1,200 LD,
                        meaning my personal earning for the entire day was about 240 LD. Each juice was sold for 10 LD.
                    </p>

                    <div
                        class="prose prose-lg sm:prose-xl max-w-none text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-justify space-y-6">

                        <p>My routine was demanding. I would leave school around <strong>1:30 PM</strong>, walk for
                            about 20 minutes to get home, quickly change my clothes, then go to check and prepare the
                            juice. I would pack it into a cooler and walk around communities and public areas selling
                            until evening. This was the daily reality I endured to support my education.</p>

                        <p>Then my uncle's wife gave my brother (cousin) and I money to start selling mosquito coils, to
                            help ourselves with the profit in getting some of our needs and doing other things, and
                            later, in <strong>April 2020</strong>, I began selling <strong>Orange and Lonestar mobile
                                minutes</strong>. The startup capital for the minutes business was provided by my
                            cousin, <strong>Richard Sumo</strong>, which he borrowed from their business, because he too
                            left the mosquito coils business and engaged in a music business with one of our in-laws at
                            the time. And I was able to repay it fully within 2 weeks. A few months later, I expanded
                            into selling men's and women's waist belts, while continuing my education with strong
                            support from my uncle and his wife, <strong>Athaniel Mulbah</strong>, and occasional
                            assistance from both my father and mother.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of my senior year (<strong>2021–2022</strong>), I transitioned from selling
                            waist-belts and joined some friends in music transfer services and local DJ work. I adopted
                            the name <strong>DJ Bequizzy</strong>, which came to me one afternoon while walking to help
                            a lady fetch water for her home. She would give me a small amount, sometimes not more than
                            <strong>LD 1,500</strong> at the end of the month, and even that was difficult to receive
                            consistently. To me, the name reflected my life story and spiritual belief "<em>God never
                                forgets anyone</em>".
                        </p>

                        <p>Despite severe financial pressure, I remained focused and committed to my education. I
                            completed my secondary education at the <strong>Pipeline Junior & Senior High School
                                (PJSHS)</strong> under the Monrovia Consolidated School System (MCSS). During that time,
                            the Superintendent was <strong>Mr. Isaac Saylakpor Zarwolo, Sr.</strong> After writing the
                            WAEC examinations in <strong>July 2022</strong>, I joined friends in a carpentry job for
                            about a month, building wooding stage around a swimming pool, hoping to raise funds for
                            graduation fees. Unfortunately, the individual leading the work deceived us, and I did not
                            receive what I expected. Though disappointed, I remained grateful for the little carpentry
                            knowledge I gained and chose to let the matter go.</p>

                        <p>By God's grace, my uncle was able to pay my graduation fees, with help from my mother and a
                            little token I received from a goodwill individual. During our graduation preparation,
                            <strong>Mrs. Josephine K. Barclay</strong> was appointed as the principal of our school,
                            PJSHS, assuming leadership of the school as we prepared to complete our secondary education.
                            Just four days before graduation, I was announced as the <strong>Valedictorian of my
                                graduating class and the entire school</strong>. This achievement brought immense pride
                            to my family and gave deeper meaning to my journey. <strong>Mr. Darvison K. Guanue</strong>,
                            our class sponsor at the time, was so proud of my achievement. He truly played the role of
                            an educator, he always had some words of encouragement for us before class begins, and
                            making references to the life story of other successful individuals.

                        <p>During the commencement ceremony, after delivering my Valedictorian's speech, I was awarded a
                            <strong>national scholarship by the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL)</strong> to
                            pursue a university education at any institution of my choice. This marked a major milestone
                            in my life.
                        </p>

                        <p>Today, I am pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> at
                            <strong>BlueCrest University Liberia</strong>, one of the leading technology institutions in
                            the country. My academic focus is <strong>Networking with an emphasis on System
                                Administration</strong>. I am also undergoing professional training at the
                            <strong>Orange Digital Center (ODC)</strong> in Web Development, Internet of Things (IoT),
                            and TinyML, while independently building skills in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> and
                            professional graphic design.
